# Palindrome check

The program asks the user to enter a string and checks if the entered string is a palindrome

### Build
```
ghc main.hs
```

### Run
```
./main
```

We can run an interactive environment that allows you to use functions (by default in interpretation mode) from the source file without running it.
```
ghci
```
